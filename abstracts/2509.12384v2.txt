Vector databases have rapidly grown in popularity, enabling effi-
cient similarity search over data such as text, images, and video.
They now play a central role in modern AI workflows, aiding large
language models by grounding model outputs in external literature
through retrieval-augmented generation. Despite their importance,
little is known about the performance characteristics of vector
databases in high-performance computing (HPC) systems that drive
large-scale science. This work presents an empirical study of dis-
tributed vector database performance on the Polaris supercomputer
in the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. We construct a
realistic biological-text workload from BV-BRC and generate em-
beddings from the peS2o corpus using Qwen3-Embedding-4B. We
select Qdrant to evaluate insertion, index construction, and query
latency with up to 32 workers. Informed by practical lessons from
our experience, this work takes a first step toward characterizing
vector database performance on HPC platforms to guide future
research and optimization. 1
