—As LLMs evolve into autonomous “AI scientists,”
they promise transformative advances but introduce novel vul-
nerabilities, from potential “biosafety risks” to “dangerous ex-
plosions.” Ensuring trustworthy deployment requires a new
paradigm centered on Reliability (factual accuracy and repro-
ducibility), Safety (preventing unintentional physical or biological
harm), and Security (preventing malicious misuse). Existing
general-purpose safety benchmarks are poorly suited for this,
suffering from fundamental domain mismatch, limited threat
coverage of science-specific vectors, and benchmark overfitting,
which creates a critical vulnerability evaluation gap. This pa-
per explores a conceptual framework to systematically define,
evaluate, and defend against these domain-specific threats. First,
to define them, this work provides a detailed taxonomy of
LLM vulnerabilities contextualized for scientific applications.
Second, to evaluate them, we examine the concept of using multi-
agent frameworks for generating domain-specific vulnerability
benchmarks to address the current gap. Finally, to defend against
them, we outline the principles of a conceptual dual-layered
defense architecture designed to combine external boundary
controls with a proactive internal Safety LLM Agent. Together,
these components outline a systematic pathway toward develop-
ing, evaluating, and deploying trustworthy LLM agents across
scientific disciplines.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The proliferation of LLMs as autonomous “AI scientists” is
poised to revolutionize scientific discovery, with applications
already emerging that autonomously conduct experiments and
facilitate discoveries across various disciplines [1]–[6]. How-
ever, this transformative potential introduces novel vulnera-
bilities and significant safety concerns that require careful
consideration [7]–[9]. The risks are not merely theoretical:
in biological research, an agent’s mistake in pathogen ma-
nipulation could lead to “biosafety risks,” or in chemistry,
incorrect reaction parameters could “trigger dangerous ex-
plosions” [10]–[12]. Given these high-stakes, it is imperative
to explore solutions such as robust “safety alignment” and
“safeguarding” frameworks [2], [13], [14].
Building such safeguarding frameworks requires rigorous,
domain-aware evaluation centered on Reliability, Safety, and
Security. In scientific contexts, reliability refers to factual
accuracy and reproducibility; safety concerns the prevention
of unintentional physical or biological harm (e.g., biorisks,
chemical hazards), extending beyond social biases; and secu-
rity involves protection against malicious or adversarial misuse
of scientific knowledge. However, existing general-purpose
benchmarks are poorly suited for these needs. Benchmarks
such as TruthfulQA [15], HaluEval [16], and FEVER [17] ad-
dress reliability (factuality) but only in a general domain. Sim-
ilarly, JailbreakBench [18] and AdvBench [19] assess security
yet overlook domain-specific exploits. Meanwhile, safety-
oriented benchmarks like ToxiGen [20] and StereoSet [21]
focus on social biases, missing critical scientific failure modes.
Collectively, these evaluations, while valuable, fail to capture
the nuanced, high-stakes risks inherent to scientific domains,
underscoring a significant gap in current LLM vulnearbility
assessment benchmarks.
This LLM vulnerability gap in scientific domains exists
largely due to three key issues. First, there is a fundamental
domain mismatch in threat definitions. General benchmarks for
bias like BBQ [22] or CEB [23], for instance, appropriately
target social stereotypes but fail to capture the forms of misuse
that matter most in scientific practice, such as generating
unsafe experimental protocols or misclassifying pathogenic
DNA sequences. Second, this gap is exacerbated by the limited
threat coverage of many general benchmarks, which focus on
popular categories like jailbreaking [24] or factuality [17],
[25], neglecting other critical vectors. Third, many existing
benchmarks are becoming outdated, as models are increasingly
fine-tuned to pass well-known tests like AdvBench [26] or
TruthfulQA [27], leading to “benchmark overfitting” [28]
rather than true safety.
Consequently, the nature of vulnerability in science differs
sharply from that in general domains. This mismatch is
evident in the poor performance of safety-aligned LLMs like
GPT, Gemini, and Claude, which, as illustrated in Figure 1,
can be prompted to provide instructions to “exploit critical
infrastructure weak points”, describe methods to “tamper
with environmental sensor data”, or suggest “plausible but
highly dangerous chemical combinations” that could trigger
dangerous explosions. Our comprehensive literature survey
(see Figure 2) further reveals a near-total absence of formal
benchmarks for other critical threats like Denial of Service,
data poisoning, and backdoor attacks tailored to scientific or
biomedical fields. These combined limitations highlight the
urgent necessity for a systematic approach to define, evalu-
ate, and defend against threats in multi-agent LLM systems
deployed in scientific domains.
Addressing this critical gap requires a holistic framework
that allows the scientific community to systematically define,
evaluate, and defend against these domain-specific threats. We
conceptualize this holistic framework, which is built on three
core components. First, to define the threats, we present a
detailed taxonomy of LLM vulnerabilities specifically con-

textualized for scientific applications. Second, to evaluate
them, and to combat the issue of outdated benchmarks, we
conceptualize an automated multi-agent benchmark genera-
tion framework for generating domain-specific vulnerability
benchmarks. This would directly address the benchmark gap
in the scientific domain by offering a rigorous and scalable
method for stress-testing AI systems against a comprehensive
range of realistic scientific threats. Finally, to defend against
these threats, we propose SHIELD, a conceptual dual-layered
defense architecture designed to operationalize this safety
paradigm. This architecture would be designed to combine ex-
ternal boundary controls with a proactive internal Safety LLM
Agent, potentially offering a robust mechanism to mitigate
both the known attack vectors identified through our taxonomy
and the unpredictable emergent threats unique to multi-agent
scientific workflows.
Our intended contributions are summarized as follows:
• Comprehensive Threat Taxonomy: We perform a struc-
tured categorization of LLM vulnerabilities specifically
tailored to scientific applications.
• Automated Benchmark Generation Framework: We
conceptualize an automated, multi-agent framework
to systematically create domain-specific vulnerability
benchmarks. Tanwi: We are not going to write this
• The SHIELD Defense Architecture: We outline the
concept for SHIELD, a dual-layered defense architecture.
