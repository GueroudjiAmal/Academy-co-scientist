Agentic artificial intelligence systems can reason, plan, and execute
complex workflows, which can speed up scientific discovery. Their
non-deterministic behavior, however, makes reliability a core chal-
lenge in domains that require safety, precision, and reproducibility.
Moreover, their autonomy can cause security threats if their per-
missions are not correctly set up. This paper proposes a practical
set of best-practice guardrails that aim to guarantee reliable Agen-
tic workflows, both from the science and cybersecurity point of
view. We organize the principles into safety, reliability, and security
sets, from intent to actuation: intent normalization, schema en-
forcement, and role-scoped tool access; uncertainty budgeting with
propagation and computed thresholds; provenance capture with
reproducible configurations, caching, and rollback; and verification
loops that include simulation cross-checks, model recalibration,
and human-in-the-loop escalation. We ground the guidance in a
case study, an Agentic chemistry framework for molecular property
prediction and automation that integrates knowledge-driven plan-
ning with high-fidelity simulation in a closed loop. We show how
the guardrails reduce common failure modes, improve end-to-end
reliability, and yield scientifically valid, reproducible outcomes. The
result is a concise set of patterns that practitioners can adopt to
build trustworthy autonomy in scientific computing.
