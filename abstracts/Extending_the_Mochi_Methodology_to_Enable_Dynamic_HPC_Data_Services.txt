—High-performance computing (HPC) applications
and workﬂows are increasingly making use of custom data ser-
vices to complement traditional parallel ﬁle systems with fast
transient data management capabilities tailored to application-
speciﬁc needs. In the Mochi project we provide methodologies
and tools that enable rapid development of custom HPC data
services, including a collection of composable software compo-
nents that can be combined to build complex distributed data
services. Our initial version of Mochi targeted data services
deployed with static conﬁgurations with a ﬁxed number of
nodes and minimal fault tolerance. However, there is a growing
need for dynamic services that can adapt while running in
response to changing workloads and system conditions.
In this paper we present our work to extend the Mochi
architecture to support the development of dynamic data
services. We achieve this by providing new Mochi components
that support uniﬁed bootstrapping and online reconﬁguration,
fault detection, monitoring, and consensus. We also provide
a methodology for deriving service-wide resilience from the
resilience of each of the service’s components.
