This concept is crucial for ensuring reproducibility, accountability, and transparency in scientific computations. Provenance in HPC workflows allows researchers to trace the lineage of data products, understand the computational processes involved, and verify results. It is particularly important in complex workflows that involve multiple computational steps, diverse data sources, and various software tools. The challenges in capturing provenance in HPC include the scale and complexity of data, the dynamic nature of workflows, and the need for efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms. Researchers have been developing frameworks and tools to automate provenance capture, integrate it seamlessly into existing HPC systems, and provide user-friendly interfaces for querying and visualizing provenance information. These efforts aim to enhance the reliability and credibility of scientific research conducted using HPC resources.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762910337, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_b1442291a8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=175, prompt_tokens=55, total_tokens=230, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
