Hypothesis: Fine-grained provenance capture improves reproducibility success rates by at least 20% compared to coarse-grained capture in HPC workflows.  \\n   • Description: Instrument two otherwise identical HPC workflows—one with fine-grained (per-task, per-I/O-call) provenance and one with coarse-grained (job-level) provenance—and attempt repeated reproductions under varying system conditions. Measure the fraction of reproductions that yield bit-identical outputs or pass domain-specific validation tests.  \\n   • Rationale: Detailed provenance (e.g., exact file checksums, environment variables, MPI ranks) should expose subtle dependencies and configuration nuances, making it easier to detect and correct sources of non-determinism. If this hypothesis is false, extra detail may not substantially aid reproducibility or may be offset by increased complexity in replay.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis: Integrating past-run provenance data into dynamic resource scheduling reduces average HPC job turnaround time by at least 15% relative to a scheduler that does not use provenance.  \\n   • Description: Augment an existing HPC scheduler with a provenance-driven prediction module that, for each new workflow, recommends node counts and wall-time based on similar previous runs’ provenance. Compare the average queue-to-completion times over a mixed workload trace with and without provenance guidance.  \\n   • Rationale: Provenance records contain rich performance and resource-usage histories. Feeding these into scheduling decisions should align resource requests closer to actual needs, reducing wasted allocation and queueing delays.
