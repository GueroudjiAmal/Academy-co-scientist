Hypothesis: Integrating fine-grained runtime provenance capture into an HPC workflow increases reproducibility success rates by ≥20% when the workflow is re-executed on different HPC systems, compared to workflows that record only coarse-grained provenance.  \\n   Description: Compare two versions of the same HPC workflow—one instrumented to capture detailed, step-by-step provenance (e.g., file hashes, environment variables, library versions, system calls) and one capturing only high-level metadata (e.g., job script, input/output file names). Re-execute both versions on two or more distinct clusters and measure the proportion of runs that produce bit-identical or analytically equivalent results.  \\n   Rationale: Detailed provenance data should supply missing configuration and environmental details essential for exact or near-exact reproductions on different systems. A measurable boost in successful reproductions would validate the value of fine-grained capture and guide provenance-tooling investments.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis: Capturing provenance at the MPI-communication level in an HPC workflow adds less than 5% average runtime overhead for workflows running on ≥1,000 processes over InfiniBand interconnects.  \\n   Description: Instrument an MPI-based workflow to log communication events (e.g., point-to-point and collective calls with message sizes and timestamps) and compare wall-clock runtimes with and without the instrumentation enabled. Run the experiment at scale (at least 1,000 parallel ranks) to assess the performance impact under realistic load.  \\n   Rationale: Provenance tools often claim “low overhead” capture, but MPI-level logging could degrade performance at scale. Demonstrating sub-5% overhead would falsify concerns about impractical performance penalties and encourage adoption of communication-level provenance in production HPC workloads.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762910605, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1088, prompt_tokens=74, total_tokens=1162, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=704, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
