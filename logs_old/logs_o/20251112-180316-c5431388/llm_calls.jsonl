Hypothesis 1: Integrating formal specification and runtime verification into AI controllers reduces the rate of critical failures by at least 30% under safety-critical conditions.  \\n   • Description: Embed formally specified safety properties (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) into the AI model’s control loop and run a lightweight verifier at runtime to check compliance before each action.  \\n   • Rationale: Formal methods provide mathematical guarantees about system behavior. By continuously checking that every action satisfies a rigorously defined specification, we expect a measurable drop in safety violations compared to purely data-driven controllers.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis 2: Augmenting deep models with calibrated uncertainty estimation and a human-in-the-loop deferral mechanism reduces misclassification on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs by at least 20%.  \\n   • Description: Equip a classifier with Bayesian or ensemble uncertainty estimates; when uncertainty exceeds a threshold, defer to human review. Measure classifier error on a held-out OOD test set with and without deferral.  \\n   • Rationale: Uncertainty estimates can flag inputs that lie outside the training distribution. By deferring those “risky” cases, the system avoids overconfident mistakes, boosting overall reliability when facing novel inputs.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762970617, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=624, prompt_tokens=72, total_tokens=696, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=320, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
