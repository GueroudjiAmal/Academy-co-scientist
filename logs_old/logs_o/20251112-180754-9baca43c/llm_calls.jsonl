Hypothesis 1  \\n   Statement: “Augmenting a standard deep-neural-network classifier with a deep-ensemble (N ≥ 5) plus post-hoc temperature scaling will reduce its expected calibration error (ECE) by at least 25% on in-distribution test data and by at least 20% on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, compared to the same network without those uncertainty modules.”  \\n   Description: Train a baseline classifier. Then train an ensemble of similarly architected models (with different random seeds) and apply temperature scaling on a validation set. Measure ECE on held-out in-distribution and OOD datasets.  \\n   Rationale: Deep ensembles capture model uncertainty across weight space, and temperature scaling corrects residual miscalibration. Together they should yield quantitatively better–calibrated confidence scores, which is critical for safely deploying AI in high-stakes settings.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis 2  \\n   Statement: “Incorporating first-order adversarial training (e.g. PGD with ε = 0.03) into the training loop will decrease the model’s error rate under the same adversarial attack by at least 20%, without increasing the clean (non-adversarial) error by more than 2%, relative to standard (non-adversarial) training.”  \\n   Description: Train two versions of the same network architecture—one with adversarial examples generated on-the-fly via projected gradient descent (PGD) at each batch, the other with only clean data. Evaluate both on (a) clean test images and (b) PGD-perturbed test images.  \\n   Rationale: Adversarial training explicitly teaches the model to resist input perturbations that would otherwise induce misclassification. A reliable AI system should maintain high accuracy even when faced with small, malicious input changes.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762970893, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1381, prompt_tokens=72, total_tokens=1453, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=960, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
