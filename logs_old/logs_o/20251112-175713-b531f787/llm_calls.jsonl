By setting a concrete 20% reduction target on a held-out adversarial test set (e.g. generated with a fixed‐strength PGD attack), we make the hypothesis directly testable—and falsifiable if the error reduction falls below that threshold.  \\n\\nHypothesis 2  \\nDescription  \\nA Bayesian neural network using Monte Carlo dropout at inference will achieve an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) ≤ 5% on an image classification benchmark, whereas the same architecture with only standard temperature scaling will have ECE ≥ 10%.  \\n\\nRationale  \\nMonte Carlo dropout approximates posterior uncertainty by sampling multiple subnetworks, which should align model confidence more closely with actual correctness rates. By comparing ECE—a standard calibration metric—under controlled settings (same architecture, training data, and temperature‐scaled baseline), we obtain a clear pass/fail criterion. If the dropout model’s ECE does not drop below 5% or the baseline falls below 10%, the hypothesis is refuted.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762970253, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=942, prompt_tokens=72, total_tokens=1014, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=640, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
