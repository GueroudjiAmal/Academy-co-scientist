Hypothesis 1  \\n   • Description: Neural classifiers trained with adversarial‐example augmentation will exhibit at least a 15% lower error rate on a held‐out, out‐of‐distribution (OOD) test set than identical models trained without adversarial augmentation.  \\n   • Rationale: Adversarial training exposes the model to worst‐case perturbations during learning, which should make its decision boundary more robust. If this procedure truly enhances reliability under distributional shift, we should see a measurable drop in OOD errors compared to a standard baseline.  \\n\\n2. Hypothesis 2  \\n   • Description: Incorporating an explicit Bayesian uncertainty estimation layer (e.g. Monte Carlo Dropout or Deep Ensembles) into an AI decision system will decrease the proportion of high-confidence misclassifications in rare or ambiguous cases by at least 20%, compared to the same system without uncertainty estimation.  \\n   • Rationale: Reliable AI should not only aim for high accuracy but also know when it doesn’t know. A Bayesian‐style uncertainty module assigns low confidence to inputs it finds ambiguous, allowing downstream processes (e.g. human review or fallback rules) to catch and correct errors. A significant reduction in confident mistakes would confirm that uncertainty estimation enhances overall system reliability.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762970467, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=812, prompt_tokens=72, total_tokens=884, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=512, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
