Hypothesis: Introducing an uncertainty‐driven abstention mechanism into a neural classifier reduces its high‐confidence error rate by at least 30% compared to the same model using a fixed softmax threshold.  \\n   • Description: Equip the model with an uncertainty estimator (e.g., Bayesian dropout or deep ensembles) that causes it to “abstain” whenever uncertainty exceeds a calibrated cutoff.  \\n   • Rationale: Overconfident misclassifications undermine reliability. By explicitly measuring and acting on epistemic uncertainty, the model should avoid making high‐confidence mistakes, a gain that can be empirically verified on held‐out test sets.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis: Deploying an automated data‐drift detection and retraining pipeline at monthly intervals maintains model accuracy within 5% of its initial performance over six months, whereas a static (never‐updated) model will degrade by more than 10%.  \\n   • Description: Continuously monitor incoming input distributions (via statistical tests such as KL divergence or population stability index). Trigger model retraining whenever drift is detected, and compare long‐term accuracy against a non-updated baseline.  \\n   • Rationale: Real‐world data distributions shift over time, leading to performance decay. A systematic drift‐aware retraining strategy should demonstrably preserve reliability, a claim that can be falsified by measuring accuracy trajectories.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762970817, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=870, prompt_tokens=72, total_tokens=942, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=576, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
