If these representations generalize, the model should make fewer mistakes on OOD samples.  \\nFalsifiability   Train two identical architectures—one with standard empirical risk minimization, the other with domain-tailored adversarial augmentation. Evaluate both on held-out OOD benchmarks; if the adversarially trained model’s error rate is not ≥20% lower, the hypothesis is rejected.  \\n\\nHypothesis 2  \\nDescription   Introducing a model-uncertainty threshold (i.e., deferring predictions when uncertainty > τ) into an AI decision pipeline will cut the rate of high-severity errors by at least 30% without increasing overall deferral (human-in-loop) requests by more than 10%.  \\nRationale    High predictive uncertainty often correlates with examples the model is likely to misclassify. By routing uncertain cases to a human or fallback system, the AI can avoid its worst mistakes while still handling the majority of inputs autonomously.  \\nFalsifiability   Instrument a deployed system to record each prediction’s uncertainty score, whether it was deferred, and whether the final outcome constituted a high-severity error. Adjust τ to meet the 10% deferral cap; if high-severity errors do not drop by ≥30% relative to no-threshold operation, the hypothesis fails.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762969880, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=809, prompt_tokens=72, total_tokens=881, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=448, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
