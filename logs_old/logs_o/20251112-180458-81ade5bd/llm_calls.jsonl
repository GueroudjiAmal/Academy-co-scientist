Hypothesis: Ensembling diverse model architectures reduces performance variability under distribution shift  \\n   • Description: An ensemble composed of at least three differently structured classifiers (e.g., a convolutional network, a transformer, and a random forest) will show a lower standard deviation of accuracy across multiple out-of-distribution test sets than its best single constituent model.  \\n   • Rationale: Diverse inductive biases mean that individual models tend to err in uncorrelated ways. Averaging their predictions should “smooth out” idiosyncratic failures, yielding more consistent performance when inputs deviate from the training distribution.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis: Displaying calibrated uncertainty scores to end users reduces inappropriate trust in incorrect AI predictions by ≥25%  \\n   • Description: In a controlled decision-making task, participants who see confidence estimates that have been temperature-scaled to match true accuracy will accept wrong AI suggestions at least 25% less often than participants who see only the AI’s top prediction.  \\n   • Rationale: Well-calibrated uncertainties help users distinguish between high- and low-reliability model outputs. When users can see that a prediction carries low confidence, they are more likely to override it, reducing decisions based on incorrect model outputs.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762970720, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1167, prompt_tokens=72, total_tokens=1239, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=896, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
