The concept of reliable AI encompasses several key aspects, including robustness, transparency, fairness, accountability, and safety.\\n\\nRobustness involves ensuring that AI systems can handle unexpected inputs and operate effectively under varying conditions without failure. Transparency pertains to the clarity and interpretability of AI decision-making processes, allowing users to understand and trust the system's outputs. Fairness addresses the need to prevent and mitigate biases in AI systems, ensuring equitable treatment across different user groups.\\n\\nAccountability in reliable AI involves establishing mechanisms for auditing and tracing AI decisions, enabling the identification and correction of errors or unintended outcomes. Safety focuses on preventing harm to users and the environment by ensuring that AI systems behave predictably and adhere to ethical guidelines.\\n\\nResearch in reliable AI aims to develop methodologies and tools to enhance these attributes, fostering trust and widespread adoption of AI technologies. This includes creating standards and frameworks for evaluating AI reliability, as well as developing techniques for testing and validating AI systems.

The payload includes three entries, each with a distinct hypothesis. The first hypothesis posits that augmenting a standard deep-neural-network classifier with a deep ensemble and post-hoc temperature scaling will significantly reduce the expected calibration error on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test data. The rationale is that deep ensembles capture model uncertainty, and temperature scaling corrects residual miscalibration, improving confidence scores. The second hypothesis suggests that incorporating first-order adversarial training, such as PGD, will decrease the model\\'s error rate under adversarial attacks without significantly increasing the error on clean data. This approach aims to enhance the model\\'s resilience to input perturbations. The context provided from the literature defines reliable AI as systems that consistently perform accurately and safely, emphasizing robustness, transparency, fairness, accountability, and safety.
