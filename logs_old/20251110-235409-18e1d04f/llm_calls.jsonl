Prior work suggests this leads to smoother gradients and increased local stability. By measuring misclassification rates under a fixed perturbation budget (e.g., ℓ∞ norm ≤ ε), we can directly test whether robustness training causally reduces attack‐induced errors.  \\n\\nFalsifiable prediction  \\nIf, under controlled experiments with held-out test data and a consistent attack algorithm, the adversarially trained model’s error rate under attack does not improve by ≥ 20 points over the baseline model, the hypothesis is rejected.  \\n\\nHypothesis 2  \\nDescription  \\nProviding end users with calibrated predictive uncertainty scores alongside an AI system’s top‐prediction will increase the users’ overall decision accuracy by at least 15 percent compared to presenting the top‐prediction alone.  \\n\\nRationale  \\nWell‐calibrated uncertainty estimates help nonexpert users decide when to defer to human judgment versus accept the AI’s suggestion.
