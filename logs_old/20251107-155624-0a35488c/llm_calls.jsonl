Hypothesis:  \\n   Incorporating Bayesian uncertainty estimation (e.g., Monte Carlo Dropout or deep ensembles) into a standard neural‐net architecture will yield a statistically significant improvement in calibration (measured by Expected Calibration Error) and reduce misclassification rate on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets by at least 20%, compared to the same architecture without uncertainty estimation.\\n\\n   Description:  \\n   Train two versions of the same base model on an in-domain dataset—one with a Bayesian uncertainty module, one without. Evaluate both on held-out in-domain data and on artificially constructed OOD inputs (e.g., by mixing in data from different but related domains). Compute calibration metrics (ECE) and classification error.\\n\\n   Rationale:  \\n   Well-calibrated confidence scores let the system “know when it doesn’t know,” enabling downstream components or human operators to defer or request review. Bayesian approaches explicitly model uncertainty, so by hypothesis they should flag OOD or ambiguous cases more accurately and thus reduce overconfident mispredictions.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis:  \\n   Embedding formal safety constraints (expressed in temporal logic) into the training loss of an autonomous‐driving AI will reduce the frequency of safety violations in simulation (e.g., entering an intersection on red, unsafe following distance) by at least 30%, relative to an otherwise identical model trained purely on imitation/reinforcement objectives.\\n\\n   Description:  \\n   Define a small set of critical safety properties in a formal specification language (e.g., “never enter intersection when light=red”). During training, add a penalty term for any predicted control sequence that violates these properties in a high-fidelity simulator. Compare the violation rates of this “formally constrained” model against a baseline trained only to maximize task reward.\\n\\n   Rationale:  \\n   Pure reward-driven or imitation-driven methods can overlook rare but critical edge‐cases. Embedding hard safety constraints steers the optimizer away from policies that satisfy average performance but still violate critical rules.
