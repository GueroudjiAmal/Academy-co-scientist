Provenance in this context is crucial for ensuring reproducibility, accountability, and transparency in scientific computations. As HPC workflows often involve complex sequences of computational tasks, capturing provenance data helps researchers understand the lineage of data products, track the execution of workflows, and debug or optimize processes. This is particularly important in scientific domains where large-scale simulations and data analyses are conducted, as it allows for the verification of results and facilitates collaboration by providing a comprehensive audit trail. Provenance data typically includes information about the computational environment, input and output data, software versions, and execution parameters. Various tools and frameworks have been developed to automate the capture and management of provenance in HPC environments, addressing challenges such as scalability, performance overhead, and integration with existing systems.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762909712, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_b1442291a8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=173, prompt_tokens=55, total_tokens=228, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
