Each is stated formally, followed by a brief description and the rationale behind it.\\n\\n1. Hypothesis: “Automated, fine-grained provenance capture during HPC workflow execution reduces the average time to reproduce and debug a failed run by at least 30% compared to manual or coarse-grained provenance collection.”  \\n   Description:  \\n   - We will compare two groups of HPC workflows processing the same scientific workload: one using an automated, fine-grained provenance system (capturing individual data reads/writes, task parameters, environment settings) and one using either manual annotation or coarse-grained logging (e.g. only job-level metadata).  \\n   - Time to repro\\xadduce and fix an induced failure (e.g. a corrupted input or mis\\xadmatched library version) will be measured in both groups.  \\n   Rationale:  \\n   - Fine-grained provenance exposes exactly which data and parameters led to a failure, so developers should find and correct the root cause more quickly.  \\n   - If finer provenance does not yield at least a 30% reduction in debug/reproduction time, this hypothesis is falsified.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis: “A provenance‐graph compression algorithm that merges semantically equivalent workflow steps can reduce storage overhead by ≥70% while enabling result-reproduction accuracy within 5% of the original uncompressed provenance.”  \\n   Description:  \\n   - We will apply a graph-summarization compression technique to provenance DAGs from a set of HPC workflows. “Semantically equivalent” steps are those with identical inputs, parameters, and container environments.  \\n   - We will measure (a) the reduction in provenance storage size and (b) the ability to reproduce final output metrics (e.g. simulation results) using only the compressed provenance.  \\n   Rationale:  \\n   - Full provenance graphs in HPC can be extremely large; compression could make long-term storage feasible.  \\n   - If compression above 70% leads to more than a 5% deviation in reproduced results, it fails to preserve essential lineage, falsifying the hypothesis.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762909699, model='o4-mini-2025-04-16', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=772, prompt_tokens=74, total_tokens=846, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=320, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
