Hypothesis 1: Adversarial\\xad-augmented training reduces out\\xad-of\\xad-distribution error variance  \\n   • Description  \\n     If a neural classifier is trained on standard examples plus a fixed proportion (e.g. 20%) of adversarially perturbed inputs (via, say, PGD), then, under controlled distribution shifts (e.g. Gaussian noise of increasing σ), the model’s error variance across shifts will be at least 30% lower than that of a baseline model trained without adversarial examples.  \\n   • Rationale  \\n     Adversarial training forces the model to learn more robust feature boundaries. By explicitly exposing it to worst-case perturbations during training, its decision surface should be flatter and less sensitive to moderate distributional changes, yielding more consistent performance (i.e. lower variance) when the test distribution drifts.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis 2: Calibrated uncertainty estimates improve human–AI decision accuracy  \\n   • Description  \\n     In a controlled decision-support study, two AI systems provide predictions on a high\\xad-stakes classification task (e.g. medical triage). System A displays raw prediction scores; System B displays scores plus calibrated confidence intervals (via isotonic regression on a held\\xad-out set).
