Provenance in HPC is crucial for ensuring reproducibility, accountability, and transparency of scientific experiments and simulations. As HPC systems handle large-scale computations and data-intensive tasks, capturing provenance information helps in understanding the computational processes, debugging, optimizing workflows, and verifying results. The complexity of HPC environments, which often involve distributed systems, diverse software tools, and heterogeneous data sources, presents challenges in effectively capturing and managing provenance data. Solutions in this domain typically involve integrating provenance capture mechanisms into workflow management systems, employing standardized data models, and utilizing scalable storage solutions to handle the vast amounts of provenance data generated. This area of research is vital for advancing scientific discovery by enabling researchers to trace the history of data, reproduce experiments, and ensure the integrity of computational results.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1762909080, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_b1442291a8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=182, prompt_tokens=55, total_tokens=237, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"}
