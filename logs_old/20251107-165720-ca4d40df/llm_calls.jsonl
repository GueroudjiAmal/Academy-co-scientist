Hypothesis: Ensemble-based uncertainty estimation yields better reliability under domain shift than single-model baselines.  \\n   Description: Train two image-classification pipelines on the same in-domain data—one a standard single neural net, the other an ensemble of neural nets whose predictive variance is used to flag low-confidence cases. Evaluate both on several held-out, systematically shifted test sets (e.g. changes in lighting, texture, minor object deformations). Measure reliability by (a) classification accuracy on accepted predictions, (b) coverage when rejecting low-confidence inputs, and (c) calibration error.  \\n   Rationale: Ensembles approximate posterior distributions more faithfully than single deterministic models. If uncertainty estimates truly reflect unfamiliar inputs, the ensemble should reject or de-prioritize those inputs and thus maintain higher accuracy and better calibration under shift. This makes the hypothesis directly testable by comparing performance metrics.\\n\\n2. Hypothesis: Embedding known causal relations into model structure stabilizes predictive accuracy under intervention-induced distributional shifts.  \\n   Description: Construct two predictive models for a decision‐making task (e.g. predicting patient response to a drug). Model A is a standard correlational model trained on observational data; Model B incorporates a causal graph (learned or expert-provided) that enforces structural relationships among features. Then simulate interventions (e.g. change in dosage protocol or demographic mix) that break original correlations. Compare drop in predictive accuracy for A versus B.  \\n   Rationale: Correlational models latch onto spurious associations that fail when the data-generating process changes. By contrast, models constrained by causal structure should generalize better across interventions.
