Hypothesis 1  \\nDescription  \\nIncorporating adversarial training with distributional‐robustness regularization into a deep classification model will reduce its error rate on both adversarially perturbed and naturally shifted test sets by at least 20% relative to a standard (ERM-trained) baseline.  \\n\\nRationale  \\nAdversarial training has been shown to improve robustness against worst-case input perturbations, while distributional-robustness regularizers (e.g. DRO or group‐DRO) mitigate performance degradation under natural dataset shift. Together, they should synergize to yield a model that makes fewer mistakes when faced with both malicious attacks and real‐world distribution changes.  \\n\\nFalsifiability  \\nTrain two identical architectures—one with ERM only, the other with the proposed combined defenses—and evaluate on (a) an established adversarial benchmark (e.g. PGD‐attacked data) and (b) a held-out shifted domain (e.g. CIFAR→CIFAR-C). If the robustly trained model’s error rate is not at least 20% lower on both sets, the hypothesis is falsified.\\n\\n2.

Bayesian or ensemble methods produce calibrated uncertainty scores. By abstaining whenever predicted confidence exceeds a preset refusal threshold, the system should dramatically cut the fraction of “high‐confidence mistakes,” thus improving end‐user reliability.  \\n\\nFalsifiability  \\nDeploy the base model with and without the uncertainty‐based reject option on a benchmark that includes in‐distribution, out‐of‐distribution, and ambiguous samples.
