Existing general-purpose safety benchmarks are poorly suited for this, suffering from fundamental domain mismatch, limited threat coverage of science-specific vectors, and benchmark overfitting, which creates a critical vulnerability evaluation gap. This pa- per explores a conceptual framework to systematically define, evaluate, and defend against these domain-specific threats. First, to define them, this work provides a detailed taxonomy of LLM vulnerabilities contextualized for scientific applications. Second, to evaluate them, we examine the concept of using multi- agent frameworks for generating domain-specific vulnerability benchmarks to address the current gap. Finally, to defend against them, we outline the principles of a conceptual dual-layered defense architecture designed to combine external boundary controls with a proactive internal Safety LLM Agent. Together, these components outline a systematic pathway toward develop- ing, evaluating, and deploying trustworthy LLM agents across scientific disciplines. Index Terms—LLMs, AI Safety, Vulnerability Benchmarks, Multi-Agent Systems, Defense Frameworks\n\n—AI-driven scientific discovery has emerged as a transformative fifth paradigm in research, with agentic AI playing an increasingly prominent role across scientific domains. Agentic AI can enable collaborative AI-human or even fully autonomous decision-making, but it also introduces significant reliability challenges due to the dynamic and evolutionary nature of the AI agents. Specifically, foundation model-powered agents are prone to generating hallucinated, misleading, or adversarial outputs that can propagate silently through workflows and corrupt downstream results. In this paper we present a concep- tual framework for a unified approach that integrates agentic workflow-level instrumentation and agent-level safeguards to enhance the reliability of the wider system, particularly critical in science. Embedding these mechanisms into a provenance- augmented infrastructure enables early detection, containment, and recovery from erroneous behavior, ultimately enhancing reliability and reproducibility in AI-assisted scientific workflows. Index Terms—Agentic AI, Agentic workflows, Reliability, Safety, Agentic Systems\n\nAgentic artificial intelligence systems can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows, which can speed up scientific discovery. Their non-deterministic behavior, however, makes reliability a core chal- lenge in domains that require safety, precision, and reproducibility. Moreover, their autonomy can cause security threats if their per- missions are not correctly set up. This paper proposes a practical set of best-practice guardrails that aim to guarantee reliable Agen- tic workflows, both from the science and cybersecurity point of view. We organize the principles into safety, reliability, and security sets, from intent to actuation: intent normalization, schema en- forcement, and role-scoped tool access; uncertainty budgeting with propagation and computed thresholds; provenance capture with reproducible configurations, caching, and rollback; and verification loops that include simulation cross-checks, model recalibration, and human-in-the-loop escalation. We ground the guidance in a case study, an Agentic chemistry framework for molecular property prediction and automation that integrates knowledge-driven plan- ning with high-fidelity simulation in a closed loop. We show how the guardrails reduce common failure modes, improve end-to-end reliability, and yield scientifically valid, reproducible outcomes. The result is a concise set of patterns that practitioners can adopt to build trustworthy autonomy in scientific computing. CCS Concepts •Computing methodologies →Distributed computing method- ologies;Parallel computing methodologies; Artificial intelligence.\n\nions. Through these abstractions, Henson allows colo- cated tasks on the same compute node to exchange data by simply passing pointers to each other with zero copies. • Libsim [9] is built on top of VisIt [10] to perform in situ visu- alization by exposing simulation data to visualization engines. With Libsim, visualization tasks use the same resources as the simulation, and they take turns operating on the same time step of data. The communication between tasks uses shared memory. • SENSEI [11] is an in situ workflow system designed with porta- bility in mind, targeting visualization applications. SENSEI allows tool portability by interfacing with different in situ tools such as ADIOS, ParaView’s Catalyst, or VisIt’s Libsim. The users can select between those tools at runtime by specifying this information within the configuration file. Moreover, SENSEI supports several data communication mechanisms (e.g., shared memory, MPI). 2.1.2. Distributed workflows Supporting scientific progress requires workflow systems to orches- trate large and complex experiments in largely distributed infrastruc- tures. The number of workflow management systems is large and continuously increasing. In some cases, these systems are used mainly by a scientific community that tailors the solution to their needs. A sample of representative distributed workflows is listed below. • PyCOMPSs [12] is a task-based programming model that en- ables the development of parallel applications and workflows. Based on annotating the Python methods and a small API, it is able to parallelize the execution at task level and to execute it in a distributed computing platform, such as clusters, clouds, container-managed clusters, and more recently edge-to-cloud en- vironments. Recent extensions to the PyCOMPSs runtime include management of individual task faults [13], checkpointing [14], workflow provenance [15], and task nesting [16]. • Pegasus [17] is a robust and scalable system that automates the execution of a number of complex applications running on a variety of heterogeneous, distributed high-throughput, and high- performance computing environments. It is built on the principle of separation between the workflow description and workflow execution, providing the ability to port and adapt the workflow based on the target execution environment. • Parsl [18] is a parallel programming library for Python. It exposes a task-based programming model in which developers annotate Python functions as Parsl apps. When invoked in a standard Python program, these apps are intercepted by Parsl and sent to the Parsl runtime for execution. Parsl is designed for scala- bility, with an extensible set of executors tailored to different use cases, such as low-latency, high-throughput, or extreme-scale execution. funcX [19] has been defined to provide a distributed function as a service platform, using Parsl’s provider interface for resource management. Parsl supports multiple executers, such as Swift/TurbineExecutor [20]. • Galaxy [21] is a web-based platform initially designed for life sciences workflows. It offers a public service and a collaborative environment, which enables sharing of analysis tools, genomic data, tutorial demonstrations, persistent workspaces, and publi- cation services. Through a web browser interface, Galaxy users can edit their workflows in a graphical editor, which are then executed through a Galaxy server. Future Generation Computer Systems 161 (2024) 502–513 503 O. Yildiz et al. • NextFlow [22] enables scalable and reproducible scientific work- flows using software containers. Mostly used by the life sciences community, it allows the adaptation of pipelines written in the most common scripting languages. Workflows are described using a domain-specific language aiming at simplifying the implementa- tion and the deployment of complex parallel workflows on clouds and clusters. • Dask [23] is an open-source Python library for parallel comput- ing. Dask scales Python code from multicore local machines to large distributed clusters in the cloud. Dask provides a familiar user interface by mirroring the APIs of other libraries in the PyData ecosystem including Pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy. Dask emphasizes two aspects: support for big data collections and dynamic task scheduling. • Autosubmit [24] is a lightweight workflow manager designed to meet climate research needs. It integrates the capabilities of an experiment manager, workflow orchestrator, and monitor in a self-contained application. The experiment manager allows for defining and configuring experiments, supported by a hierarchical database that ensures reproducibility and traceability. The orches- trator is designed to run workflows in research and operational mode by managing their dependencies and interfacing with local and remote hosts. • RADICAL-Pilot (RP) [25] is a modular and extensible Python- based pilot system. It is a self-contained pilot system that can be used to provide a runtime system for workloads comprising multiple tasks. RP can be used standalone, as well as integrated with other application-level tools as a runtime system. • Common Workflow Language (CWL) [26] is an open standard for describing how to run command line tools and connect them to create workflows. While CWL is not a workflow management system, we believe it is relevant here because of its signifi- cant adoption in the community. Tools and workflows described using CWL are portable across a variety of platforms that sup- port the CWL standards. Using CWL, a user can easily scale complex data analysis and machine learning workflows from a single developer’s laptop to massively parallel cluster, cloud, and high-performance computing environments. 2.2. Data models If all the tasks in a workflow share the same data model, the data exchanged between the different tasks will likely use this common data model. However, when there are different data models in the same workflow, two possibilities exist: either selecting one of those models and transforming all the data to it or proposing a new data model and making all the tasks use it. In traditional workflows, where data exchanges go through files, the associated data model is usually inspired by the file format. For exam- ple, workflows using HDF5 files use the HDF5 data model. Similarly, in visualization workflows using ParaView, VTK files employ the VTK data model. File-inspired data models can also be used for in situ workflows, bypassing physical file storage but maintaining the file semantics. For instance, LowFive [27] uses the HDF5 data model for in situ processing. VTK is commonly used in ParaView Catalyst [28] and VisIt Libsim [9] as well as in the more generic platform SENSEI [11]. Lightweight libraries such as Conduit [29] and PDI [30] have the advantage of describing the data model independently from the ap- plication, making them good candidates for in situ workflows. They are generic and describe the data model in YAML or JSON format. For instance, a simulation instrumented with PDI uses the same data model for checkpointing into HDF5 or netCDF formats for processing data in situ using SENSEI. ADIOS [2,31] is another example of a system providing its own data model that can be used by the supported backends for physical storage and in situ processing. Bredala [32] is the data model associated with the Decaf [6] in situ system. It annotates the data fields and sends these annotations with the data, to protect their semantics while redistributing them. Deisa [33], a Dask-enabled in situ processing library, is built on top of the PDI data model and adds a virtual global data structure to the PDI YAML to map local data into a spatiotemporal distribution. This description is shared with the Dask analytics to protect the semantics as well. 2.3. Data transfer mechanisms One of the main capabilities of workflow systems is to automate data transfers between the workflow tasks. Data transfer mechanisms differ depending on the type of workflow system, and they also vary among different workflow systems of the same type. In situ workflows often communicate through shared memory or interconnect fabric, while distributed workflows communicate through files. Shared memory can offer benefits for workflow systems when the tasks are on the same node by enabling zero-copy communication. In situ solutions such as Libsim and Catalyst adopt shared-memory communication between analysis and visualization tasks running syn- chronously with the simulation. Henson uses shared memory to ex- change data between the colocated tasks on the same node by dy- namically loading the executables of these tasks into the same address space. When the tasks are located on separate compute nodes in the same system, workflow systems can communicate through the system interconnect, enabling fast communication by avoiding the parallel file system. This communication usually takes two forms: direct messaging and data staging. Systems such as Damaris and Decaf create a direct communication channel among the workflow tasks and use direct messaging via MPI to exchange data between the workflow tasks. On the other hand, some systems such as DataSpaces [34] and Colza [35] use a separate staging area, which is shared by the workflow tasks as a distributed memory space. DataSpaces, Colza, and Deisa use remote procedure calls (RPCs) for communications. DataSpaces and Colza rely on Mercury [36] whereas Deisa relies on Dask’s RPC implementation. These systems are con- tributing to the recent trend to employ alternative communication solutions rather than MPI to communicate through the interconnect. This trend is due mainly to limitations of MPI such as lack of elasticity or fault tolerance. The dynamicity of RPC-based systems provides an interesting alternative for irregular applications, rather than relying on a static and regular communication pattern of MPI. File-based communication provides the least efficient data transfer mechanism for workflow systems, given the storage bottlenecks of to- day’s machines. However, this communication method allows workflow systems to communicate between the tasks that can be located at sev- eral independent machines in a wide area. Some examples of workflow systems that use files for communication are Pegasus, PyCOMPSs, and Parsl. 3. Featured workflow systems In this section we characterize extreme-scale workflow systems developed by JLESC participating institutions in terms of workflow specification, execution model, data model and transport, and appli- cations. 3.1. Wilkins Wilkins [37] is an in situ workflow system currently under de- velopment that enables dynamic heterogeneous task specification and execution for in situ processing. 1 Wilkins provides a data-centric API for defining the workflow graph, creates and launches tasks, and estab- lishes communicators between the tasks. 1 Wilkins is available at https://github.com/orcunyildiz/wilkins/. Future Generation Computer Systems 161 (2024) 502–513 504 O. Yildiz et al. Fig. 1. Example of three tasks coupled through the LowFive in situ data transport library. Workflow specification. Wilkins has a data-centric workflow definition, where users indicate tasks’ resource and data requirements using a YAML configuration file. Based on these data requirements, Wilkins automatically creates the communication channels between the work- flow tasks and generates the workflow graph as a representation of this workflow configuration file. Wilkins supports any directed-graph topology of tasks, including common patterns such as pipeline, fan-in, fan-out, ensembles of tasks, and cycles. Execution model. The Wilkins runtime has a Python driver that reads this workflow specification upon initialization and launches the work- flow. In this workflow, individual codes can be serial or parallel; they can also have different languages such as C, C ++, Python, or Fortran. All the workflow functions (e.g., data transfers, data model specifica- tions) are defined through this Python driver, with no modifications needed for the user codes. The Python driver code is provided by the Wilkins system; the user needs to supply only the constituent task codes and the workflow configuration file. Each of the task codes can be an MPI parallel program. Although Wilkins executes the task codes in single program, multiple data (SPMD) style—in other words, the tasks are a partitioning of the global MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator, each of the tasks is written in a singular standalone fashion, using the MPI_COMM_WORLD as if it were the only user of that communicator. Wilkins manages the partitioning of the global world communicator into separate local communicators, one for each task, as well as the intercommunicators connecting tasks. This is all entirely transparent to the user task codes. Data model. As shown in Fig. 1 , Wilkins employs the data model of LowFive [27], which is a data model specification, redistribution, and communication library, implemented as an HDF5 virtual object layer (VOL) plugin. HDF5 [38] is one of the most common data models, and LowFive as a VOL plugin benefits from HDF5’s rich metadata describing the data model while affording users the familiarity of HDF5. Data transport. As its data transport layer, Wilkins uses the data redis- tribution components of LowFive, which supports data redistribution from 𝑀 to 𝑁 processes. Wilkins allows coupled tasks to communi- cate both in situ, using MPI message passing, and through traditional HDF5 files if needed. Users can select these different communica- tion mechanisms in the workflow configuration file prior to workflow execution. Applications. The LowFive library [ 27] has been evaluated in a high- energy physics use case, where the science campaign consisted of the Nyx [ 39] cosmological simulation and Reeber [ 40] analysis code. Fig. 2. Overview of Melissa architecture. The server is here set for online training a deep surrogate model with data parallelism on multiple GPUs. LowFive enabled scalable I/O performance, while requiring no source- code modifications to the workflow tasks. Additional use cases for Wilkins in climate science and molecular dynamics are currently being developed. 3.2. Melissa Melissa [ 41] is a file-avoiding, fault-tolerant, and elastic frame- work used to run large-scale ensembles and process them in situ. An ensemble run consists of executing the same simulation code several times but with different input parameters to get a probabilistic estimate of the simulation behavior. Ensemble runs are used for various use cases ranging from uncertainty quantification or Bayesian inference to reinforcement learning. Each instance being a parallel code often producing significant amounts of data, ensembles that can account for thousands of instances are usually very I/O intensive, especially if these\n\n—Understanding performance and provenance of task-based workflows poses significant challenges, particularly in distributed configurations where resources are shared by multiple applications. Task-based workflow management systems further complicate performance predictability because of their dynam- icity that subtly alters task execution order from run to run. In this paper we propose a layered characterization framework for performance and task provenance for Dask.distributed workflows running on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. It collects data from jobs, the workflow management system, and the operating system to aid in understanding the performance of these workflows. Our approach encompasses three main contributions: first, an extension of Dask.distributed to capture high-fidelity task provenance using Mochi data services; second, the adaptation of the established HPC I/O characterization tool Darshan to gather high-fidelity I/O data, thereby enhancing the granularity of our analysis; and third, a framework to combine and process the collected data and provide helpful insights into performance characterization and reproducibility, alongside our lessons learned.
