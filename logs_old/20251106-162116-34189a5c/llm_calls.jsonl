Existing general-purpose safety benchmarks are poorly suited for this, suffering from fundamental domain mismatch, limited threat coverage of science-specific vectors, and benchmark overfitting, which creates a critical vulnerability evaluation gap. This pa- per explores a conceptual framework to systematically define, evaluate, and defend against these domain-specific threats. First, to define them, this work provides a detailed taxonomy of LLM vulnerabilities contextualized for scientific applications. Second, to evaluate them, we examine the concept of using multi- agent frameworks for generating domain-specific vulnerability benchmarks to address the current gap. Finally, to defend against them, we outline the principles of a conceptual dual-layered defense architecture designed to combine external boundary controls with a proactive internal Safety LLM Agent. Together, these components outline a systematic pathway toward develop- ing, evaluating, and deploying trustworthy LLM agents across scientific disciplines. Index Terms—LLMs, AI Safety, Vulnerability Benchmarks, Multi-Agent Systems, Defense Frameworks I. I NTRODUCTION The proliferation of LLMs as autonomous “AI scientists” is poised to revolutionize scientific discovery, with applications already emerging that autonomously conduct experiments and facilitate discoveries across various disciplines [1]–[6]. How- ever, this transformative potential introduces novel vulnera- bilities and significant safety concerns that require careful consideration [7]–[9]. The risks are not merely theoretical: in biolo\n\n—AI-driven scientific discovery has emerged as a transformative fifth paradigm in research, with agentic AI playing an increasingly prominent role across scientific domains. Agentic AI can enable collaborative AI-human or even fully autonomous decision-making, but it also introduces significant reliability challenges due to the dynamic and evolutionary nature of the AI agents. Specifically, foundation model-powered agents are prone to generating hallucinated, misleading, or adversarial outputs that can propagate silently through workflows and corrupt downstream\n\nAgentic artificial intelligence systems can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows, which can speed up scientific discovery. Their non-deterministic behavior, however, makes reliability a core chal- lenge in domains that require safety, precision, and reproducibility. Moreover, their autonomy can cause security threats if their per- missions are not correctly set up. This paper proposes a practical set of best-practice guardrails that aim to guarantee reliable Agen- tic workflows, both from the science and cybersecurity point of view. We organize the principles into safety, reliability, and security sets, from intent to actuation: intent normalization, schema en- forcement, and role-scoped tool access; uncertainty budgeting with propagation and computed thresholds; provenance capture with reproducible configurations, caching, and rollback; and verification loops that include simulation cross-checks, model recalibration, and human-in-the-loop escalation. We ground the guidance in a case study, an Agentic chemistry framework for molecular property prediction and automation that integrates knowledge-driven plan- ning with high-fidelity simulation in a closed loop. We show how the guardrails reduce common failure modes, improve end-to-end reliability, and yield scientifically valid, reproducible outcomes. The result is a concise set of patterns that practitioners can adopt to build trustworthy autonomy in scientific computing.

Task-based workflow management systems further complicate performance predictability because of their dynam- icity that subtly alters task execution order from run to run. In this paper we propose a layered characterization framework for performance and task provenance for Dask.distributed workflows running on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. It collects data from jobs, the workflow management system, and the operating system to aid in understanding the performance of these workflows. Our approach encompasses three main contributions: first, an extension of Dask.distributed to capture high-fidelity task provenance using Mochi data services; second, the adaptation of the established HPC I/O characterization tool Darshan to gather high-fidelity I/O data, thereby enhancing the granularity of our analysis; and third, a framework to combine and process the collected data and provide helpful insights into performance characterization and reproducibility, alongside our lessons learned. Index Terms—High-performance computing (HPC), task-based workflows, performance characterization, performance variabil- ity, provenance, performance reproducibility, Dask I. I NTRODUCTION Scientific workflows executed on high-performance, het- erogeneous computing environments rely on the complex composition of system software, middleware services, and ap- plication codes [1]. Pythonic task-based programming models are increasingly prevalent for large-scale computations and data-intensive processing because of their high productivity. Examples of such tools include Parsl [2], Dask [3], and RADICAL-Pilot [4]. In contrast to traditional MPI-based workflows, which are predominantly static in nature and where the tasks assigned to each MPI process are known in advance, task-based workflows are dy", "instance_id": null, "audit_path": null, "call_type": "brainstorm_hypotheses"}, "response": "ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-CYx26yhQd12OLfoXh6bAGx2VmmHHM', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Here are two distinct, falsifiable hypotheses on how narcissism relates to toxicity and sexism in the scientific community.
