Existing\ngeneral-purpose safety benchmarks are poorly suited for this,\nsuffering from fundamental domain mismatch, limited threat\ncoverage of science-specific vectors, and benchmark overfitting,\nwhich creates a critical vulnerability evaluation gap. This pa-\nper explores a conceptual framework to systematically define,\nevaluate, and defend against these domain-specific threats. First,\nto define them, this work provides a detailed taxonomy of\nLLM vulnerabilities contextualized for scientific applications.\nSecond, to evaluate them, we examine the concept of using multi-\nagent frameworks for generating domain-specific vulnerability\nbenchmarks to address the current gap. Finally, to defend against\nthem, we outline the principles of a conceptual dual-layered\ndefense architecture designed to combine external boundary\ncontrols with a proactive internal Safety LLM Agent. Together,\nthese components outline a systematic pathway toward develop-\ning, evaluating, and deploying trustworthy LLM agents across\nscientific disciplines.\nIndex Terms—LLMs, AI Safety, Vulnerability Benchmarks,\nMulti-Agent Systems, Defense Frameworks\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe proliferation of LLMs as autonomous “AI scientists” is\npoised to revolutionize scientific discovery, with applications\nalready emerging that autonomously conduct experiments and\nfacilitate discoveries across various disciplines [1]–[6]. How-\never, this transformative potential introduces novel vulnera-\nbilities and significant safety concerns that require careful\nconsideration [7]–[9]. The risks are not merely theoretical:\n\nAbstract—AI-driven scientific discovery has emerged as a\ntransformative fifth paradigm in research, with agentic AI\nplaying an increasingly prominent role across scientific domains.\nAgentic AI can enable collaborative AI-human or even fully\nautonomous decision-making, but it also introduces significant\nreliability challenges due to the dynamic and evolutionary nature\nof the AI agents. Specifically, foundation model-powered agents\nare prone to generating hallucinated, misleading, or adversarial\noutputs that can propagate silently through workflows and\ncorrupt downstream results. In this paper we present a concep-\ntual framework for a unified approach that integrates agentic\nworkflow-level instrumentation and agent-level safeguards to\nenhance the reliability of the wider system, particularly critical\nin science. Embedding these mechanisms into a provenance-\naugmented infrastructure enables early detection, containment,\nand recovery from erroneous behavior, ultimately enhancing\nreliability and reproducibility in AI-assisted scientific workflows.\nIndex Terms—Agentic AI, Agentic workflows, Reliability,\nSafety, Agentic Systems\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nBuilding on the paradigms of empirical observation, theo-\nretical modeling, computational simulation, and data-intensive\nscience, a fifth paradigm—AI-driven scientific discovery—has\nemerged as a transformative force in research [1]–[3]. Among\nAI-driven methodologies, agentic AI shows particular promise\nfor addressing complex scientific problems, enabling advanced\ndecision-making with minimal human intervention [4]–[6].\nThis new paradigm is playing an increasingly critical role\nacross a wide range of scientific disciplines, including biol-\nogy [7], chemistry [8], materials science [9], medicine [10],\nand economics [11].\nAgentic AI refers to intelligent systems that can au-\ntonomously perceive, plan, and act to accomplish complex\ngoals over extended time horizons.

Their\nnon-deterministic behavior, however, makes reliability a core chal-\nlenge in domains that require safety, precision, and reproducibility.\nMoreover, their autonomy can cause security threats if their per-\nmissions are not correctly set up. This paper proposes a practical\nset of best-practice guardrails that aim to guarantee reliable Agen-\ntic workflows, both from the science and cybersecurity point of\nview. We organize the principles into safety, reliability, and security\nsets, from intent to actuation: intent normalization, schema en-\nforcement, and role-scoped tool access; uncertainty budgeting with\npropagation and computed thresholds; provenance capture with\nreproducible configurations, caching, and rollback; and verification\nloops that include simulation cross-checks, model recalibration,\nand human-in-the-loop escalation. We ground the guidance in a\ncase study, an Agentic chemistry framework for molecular property\nprediction and automation that integrates knowledge-driven plan-\nning with high-fidelity simulation in a closed loop. We show how\nthe guardrails reduce common failure modes, improve end-to-end\nreliability, and yield scientifically valid, reproducible outcomes. The\nresult is a concise set of patterns that practitioners can adopt to\nbuild trustworthy autonomy in scientific computing.\nCCS Concepts\n•Computing methodologies →Distributed computing method-\nologies;Parallel computing methodologies; Artificial intelligence.\nKeywords\nReliable Agentic AI, Agentic Workflows, Computational Chemistry\nACM Reference Format:\n. 2026.

In\nthis paper we propose a layered characterization framework for\nperformance and task provenance for Dask.distributed workflows\nrunning on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. It\ncollects data from jobs, the workflow management system, and\nthe operating system to aid in understanding the performance\nof these workflows. Our approach encompasses three main\ncontributions: first, an extension of Dask.distributed to capture\nhigh-fidelity task provenance using Mochi data services; second,\nthe adaptation of the established HPC I/O characterization tool\nDarshan to gather high-fidelity I/O data, thereby enhancing the\ngranularity of our analysis; and third, a framework to combine\nand process the collected data and provide helpful insights into\nperformance characterization and reproducibility, alongside our\nlessons learned.\nIndex Terms—High-performance computing (HPC), task-based\nworkflows, performance characterization, performance variabil-\nity, provenance, performance reproducibility, Dask\nI.
